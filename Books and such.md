## Converting a Kobo book to mobi for Kindle

This process can convert a book is already in your Kobo library into a mobi format that can be read on Kindle. You'll need *Calibre* and *Adobe Digital Editions*.
1. Go to kobo.com and log in to your account. Click on My Account and go to My Books.
2. Click the three dots on the cook that you would like to download, and select "Download." This downloads a .acsm file (which is some sort of digital rights thing?).
3. Open Adobe Digital Editions and drag the .acsm file in. It should recognize the file and dowlonad the .epub file.
4. Drag the .epub file in to Calibre. Then right click on the title in the library and select "Convert books."
